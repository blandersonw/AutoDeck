# GenerativePresentation
We created a google slides plugin that can generate a presentation on any topic. The plugin works best on decks of <10 slides, with a sweet spot around 5-7.

Here is an example:

Generated Presentation 1: Multivariable Calculus - showcases application using real-world, complex topics.

Generated Presentation 2: The War on Antarctic Camels - showcases application imagining a false reality.

## Disclaimer:
This application uses GPT-3 for content creation.  GPT-3 can confidently respond to prompts with false information, as demonstrated in the Antarctic Camels example.  Information in presentations may not be factual and should be reviewed before shared in any form.

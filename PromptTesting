Obviously this did not produce 6-8 slides and the content wasn't great.

Upon a number of iterations, it appears that a long-form script does not perform as well as gradual instruction. Allowing users to confirm content choices, one step at a time, will also give the user greater customizability in regards to their presentation.

The following list of subtopics is about the threats to monkeys in Africa. Using the following list of subtopics, produce body content for a powerpoint presentation.  Body content should be primarily bullet points consisting of key points, with occasional short sentences.  Each subtopic should be displayed like so: "(Subtopic Name) [insert new line here] Body Content: '__'". 

1. Habitat Loss and Degradation
2. Hunting and Poaching
3. Human-Wildlife Conflict
4. Disease Transmission
5. Climate Change
6. Illegal Pet Trade
7. Pesticide Poisoning
8. Invasive Species

Habitat Loss and Degradation:
- Most of Africaâ€™s native forests are under threat
- Deforestation and conversion of land for agriculture and human habitation leads to fragmentation and loss of habitat
- Fragmentation of habitats can lead to isolation of monkey populations
- Inadequate protection of natural habitats

Hunting and Poaching:
- Hunting of monkeys for bushmeat and other products 
- Poaching of monkeys for international pet trade
- Unsustainable hunting and poaching can lead to population decline

Human-Wildlife Conflict:
- Conflict with humans over resources, e.g. food and water 
- Habitat encroachment and displacement of monkeys 
- Road construction that results in fragmentation of habitats

Disease Transmission:
- Transmitted from humans to monkeys, e.g. polio
- Transmitted from domestic animals to monkeys, e.g. rabies

Climate Change:
- Changes in climate can lead to changes in food availability 
- Changes in temperatures can lead to changes in the spread of infectious diseases

Illegal Pet Trade:
- Poaching of monkeys for international pet trade
- Unregulated and illegal pet trade can lead to population decline

Pesticide Poisoning: 
- Accidental poisoning of monkeys through consumption of contaminated food and water
- Direct exposure to pesticides through spraying programs

Invasive Species:
- Introduction of non-native species to monkey habitats
- Competition for resources with non-native species
